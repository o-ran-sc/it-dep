      "message": "The real world scenario is that the cluster admin will deploy the infra and the RIC admin will deploy platform. This means that the global settings used by the infra team has to be passed to the platform team. We cannot assume that both team can refer to the same source of the yaml file that contains the shared key:values.\n\nIf that\u0027s the case, I think it makes more sense to include all the settings in one yaml file instead of two.\n\nWhat I think should happen is that the deploy-ric-infra script should generate the skeleton of the platform recipe, and send it to the platform team for further configuration. This will make sure that the global values are in sync.\n\nthought?",
