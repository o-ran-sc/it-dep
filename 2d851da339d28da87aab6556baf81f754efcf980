      "message": "I\u0027m a bit concerned about this part - but Im not sure how this would work. \n\nWill this change the root \u0027URL\u0027 or the path within the repo thats needed to actually use the charts? \nOr will this overwrite the chart version number already part of the charts? \n\nIm guessing this might make using the released charts instead of the snapshot charts (for the same version) a bit more involved than just changing the repo name? \n\nIm guessing by looking at https://github.com/lfreleng-actions/nexus-publish-action?tab\u003dreadme-ov-file#raw-files-upload that this would prepend the version number (i.e. tag) to the path which would then: \n1: change the helm artifact \u0027name\u0027 to include a version\n2: add another version, since there will also be a version later in the path based on the local chart version number? i.e. 2 possibly different version numbers?",

      "message": "It would potentially change the path in the release repository to include a top level folder, under which all the existing unmodified chart names would be published. The existing structure in Nexus3 for snapshots is flat:\nhttps://nexus3.o-ran-sc.org/#browse/browse:helm.snapshot\nEach component is its own folder at the top.\nI\u0027ve made a patch to the workflow to allow for an empty path to be used, which should preserve the existing behaviour we have in the helm.snapshots repository. We can test that manually with workflow_dispatch to see if this is an issue or not.",
