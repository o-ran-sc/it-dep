      "message": "just wondering: would it be possible to somehow extract this data from the configmap definition into a separate file â€” either by specifying it in values.yaml or maybe as an external file (as with string_int_mapping) that gets expanded into the route map?  there seems to be both a lot of repetition here and an implication you\u0027d redeploy the whole chart when the configmap changes.\n\nfurther, will other stuff use the same (or approximately the same) route map?  if so, it seems like everything should get it from the same place.\n\nnot a big deal and i don\u0027t really understand the application well enough to know.",

      "message": "This file was done by the RIC platform team (integration? E2e?) I am also opposed to what is here because it contains MANY things that a1 does not care about. This file only needs to include two entries which is what I originally had; but it looks like someone copy pastad this into each RIC component. So, I agree with you but I think this question should be submitted to the integration/e2e team.",
