# Executing the container "as a binary" will cause the CI publish
# script to execute.  This will take the simple package list generated
# by the ci_build script and copy the list of packages to the target
# directory.  The target directory is /export by default, but can be
# overridden from the docker run command line. In either case, the 
# assumption is that the target directory is mounted as a volume.
